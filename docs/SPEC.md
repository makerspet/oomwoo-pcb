## Compute + Camera

- 2x 15-pin ArduCam-style connectors for OV5647
- TODO add USB to I/O board

Undecided TODO 
- maybe provision an M.2 slot, route a PICe lane, populate later - to experiment with NPU accelerator(s) like Hailo
- USB-C 3.0+, CM5 only - to experiment with accelerator(s) like Coral TPU
- Keep the compute socket able to take an integrated-NPU module too (Radxa CM5) or premium-upgradeable (CM5 + M.2 Hailo).
- Flag it to the PCB contractor as a design item: M.2 E-key (WiFi) + an M.2 M-key/PCIe (NPU or NVMe), PCIe lane routing, and the thermal path for a few-watt accelerator in a suction-cooled enclosure

### Robot

- the robot has 2 power inputs: USB-C and dock
  - robot receives 20-24V fixed DC from the dock
  - USB-C power use PD, request 20-24 V minimum (to step it down to 4S battery)
  - optional PPS
  - if a low-power USB-C 5V, 9V or 15V brick source is attached (no 20V/PPS), either charge slowly (optional) through a boost path or cleanly refuse and signal "insufficient charger" rather than misbehaving
- robot requires 65W minimum input (from the dock) with system power-path charger (a charger IC with a SYS rail)
  - support the vacuum charging and Raspberry Pi running simultaneously
  - assume Raspberry Pi is always on (to handle user access over Wi-Fi at any time)
  - Pi CM5 worst case ~15.6W
  - M.2
  - Healthy charge ~40 W (~0.5C into the 75 Wh pack)
  - ~65–70 W total
- cap charge at ~0.5C regardless of charging adapter power
- MCU reset drops everything to a safe state, so motors are off during reset, firmware upload and firmware crash
  - watchdog

### Dock

- the dock is powered from an external certified 24/25.2 V DC brick (~200–350 W)
  - use external brick for safety, the dock enclosure only ever sees 24 V DC
  - reuse a 25.2 V stick-vac motor for auto-empty, e.g. Dreame M10-E-4 25.2 V/310 W
- the dock has only 2 contacts: DOCK+ and GND
  - dock contacts feed a fixed 24V+ DC
  - the dock detects load/robot presence, energizes DOCK+ only when robot is detected (reliably, after a couple of seconds)
  - dock contacts are spring loaded, gold-coated pogo pins ≥4 A, placed rear-vertical, above water line
- ambient fan(s) for mop drying
  - no hot mop dry for now
- 2x water pumps: clean-feed + dirty-evacuate
  - diaphragm, 12–24 V
- dock PCB
  - ESP32 (WiFi + BLE + control)
  - Pump/fan drivers (brushed DC)
  - IR beacon LEDs + driver
  - robot/load presence-detect + charging contact energize FET
  - Level sensors (float/capacitive) clean-low, dirty-full
  - high-side FET for auto-empty blower
  - fuse, DC inlet, TVS
  - buck DC-DC 24V to 5V, 3.3V for ESP32, sensors

### Power path

Standard capability of power-path charger ICs - TI bq25 family and similar.

```
USB-C 20V ─► [PD sink] ─► [power-path charger] ─┬─► SYS rail ─► 14.4→5V buck ─► Pi (always-on)
                                                └─► charges 4S pack
Battery ────────────────────────────────────────┘ (supplements SYS if input insufficient)
```

- Docked: the Pi runs from the input via SYS; the battery charges from the surplus; once full, charge current → 0 and the Pi keeps running off input — no needless battery cycling while docked (also a longevity win).
- Undocked: SYS seamlessly falls back to the battery — the Pi never browns out during the handoff. This is exactly what makes "pause → return to charge → resume" and "app connects anytime" work cleanly.
- Input-limited: if only a weak brick is attached, the battery supplements SYS so the Pi stays up, and charge current backs off. Graceful degradation for free.

Details

1. 65 W = 20 V / 3.25 A → e-marked cable required. Above 3 A / 60 W, USB-C needs a 5 A e-marked cable. Unavoidable at 65 W (20 V is PD's max fixed voltage) — just document it. 65 W bricks ship with an e-marked cable anyway.
2. Dynamic power management (VIN/IIN-DPM): the charger must throttle charge current to keep total draw within the negotiated PD budget, prioritizing the Pi/SYS load. Standard on power-path chargers.
3. Cap charge current at ~0.5C (~2.6 A into the pack) for cell life, regardless of surplus — don't let a big brick fast-charge the cells.
4. Two DC inputs, one charger: the robot's own USB-C port and the dock contacts both present ~20 V DC → OR them into the charger's VBUS with priority/ideal-diode selection (both are the same voltage, so it's clean).
5. Dock side: dock has its own PD sink + 65 W brick, passes ~20 V to the contacts. At 20 V, 65 W ≈ 3.25 A over the contacts → size the pogo/spring contacts for ~4 A with margin.

Net spec

1. USB-C PD, 65 W minimum (20 V / 3.25 A), on both the robot port and the dock (each with its own PD sink); e-marked cable expected.
2. Power-path 4S charger with a SYS rail feeding the Pi's 5 V buck, so the Pi is always-on from input when docked and from battery when not, with seamless handoff and battery-supplement under load.
3. DPM + 0.5C charge-current cap; OR the two DC inputs into one VBUS; dock contacts rated ~4 A.

## Carpet sensors

- Read [sourcing notes](https://makerspet.com/blog/how-to-source-bom-for-oomwoo-open-source-vacuum-robot/#carpet-sensor).

How to drive
- ≥12V DC stabilized per spec (not 4S battery directly?)
- connect to MCU ADC input
  - use STM32G473VCT6 internal op-amp as echo input (AC via a cap)
  - clamp amplitude to 3.3V (back-to-back clamp diodes, series resistor)
  - bias the MCU internal op-amp to Vref/2 using MCU internal DAC
  - configure ADC pre-amp gain, PGA mode (op-amp bandwidth is 10MHz)
  - configure op-amp to output signal to internal ADC channel
- FET half-bridge driven by MCU
  - drive the sensor for a brief while
  - tristate both FETs
  - measure using ADC, calculate return amplitude
  - calibrate return amplitude when docked
- 2-pin connector "1.25mm Y" per spec, exact model unclear
  - not Molex PicoBlade 1.25mm, not JST GH 1.25mm
